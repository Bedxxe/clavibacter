I was invited to participate in a project to uncover the presence of a group of bacterial lineajes from the genus 
_Clavibacter_ in different cultivars. As planned by my Sensei (Professor Nelly Selem-Mojica), we will use 
both approximation of metagenomics (_i.e._ Metabarcoding and Shotgun) to try to obtain some answers 
from the questions that were formulated because of the widely presence of these lineages.

This repository is to manage, create, and allocate the data from the Clavibacter project (Selem-Mojica, et al. 2022)
